        <h1>Here are some tips that will help you every day</h1>
        <h2>1. Use nail polish to identify different keys</h2>
        <p>Organise your life with this simple time-saving trick. If you've got a few minutes to spare and some nail varnish bottles lying around, this hack is well worth a try. You'll no longer need to rabble about finding the right one, plus the pops of colour will help your set stand out in your bag.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Freeze grapes to chill your drink without it getting watered down</h2>
        <p>When it comes to DIY hacks, this one is a must-try. The next time you're making a drink that you don't want to be diluted by the water when it melts (such as white wine, lemonade, or orange juice) use frozen grapes instead of ice cubes. That way when it melts, your drink won't be watered down. Added bonus: frozen grapes are refreshing to eat during summer.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Put milk in your nearly empty Nutella or peanut butter jar</h2>
        <p>The next time your chocolate spread, peanut butter or jam jars are nearly empty? Add some milk to the mix, then screw the lid back on (well) and shake for a minute or two to create a tasty homemade milkshake! You'll be using up leftovers that would otherwise be binned and you get to enjoy a sweet treat too!
        </p>
        <h2>4. Put a wooden spoon across a boiling pot of water to keep it from boiling over</h2>
        <p>This one is probably one of the most well-known life hacks for home, but it does work! Why? Well, a few reasons. The wood is a natural repellent which (for chemistry reasons) causes the bubbles to stop rising. Also, the spoon is at a cooler temperature than the water, meaning that once the bubbles reach the spoon, the steam and bubbles condense back into the water.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Use hair straighteners to iron collars</h2>
        <p>This one only works if you're wearing a jumper or something else that will cover up the rest of your shirt... If you're rushing out the door but you need to freshen up your look, consider ironing your shirt collar with hair straighteners. It will smarten up your look and dramatically reduce your 'getting ready' time.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Wrap your cheese in parchment paper</h2>
        <p>Did you know that cheese lasts longer when it can 'breathe'? Rather than wrapping your cheddar up in cling film or tin foil, secure it in waxed or greaseproof paper. (you might want to put it in a food container to stop it from stinking out your food in the fridge). 
        </p>
        <h2>7. Use bread clips to organise your power cables</h2>
        <p>Organise your cables and de-clutter your house with this easy household life hack. The next time you buy a loaf, be sure to save your bread tags. They have a whole range of uses including untangling your power charges. Plus, the different tag colours will help you tell them apart.
        </p>
        <h2>8. To clean your shower head. Tie a bag of vinegar around your shower head and leave it overnight</h2>
        <p>This is one of the coolest hacks for those of you that don't like cleaning (aka basically everyone). Simply put some vinegar in a ziplock bag and tie it around your shower head with an elastic band, making sure that the shower nozzle is submerged in the vinegar. Leave it overnight and by the time you come back to it in the morning, all the limescale buildup should be gone!
        </p>
        <h2>9. Put a paper towel under your fruit and vegetables in the fridge </h2>
        <p>If you're storing loose fruit and vegetables in the fridge, pop a paper towel under them. This way, it will soak up all the water and help them to last for longer.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Rub a walnut on damaged wooden furniture to cover up scratches</h2>
        <p>Did you know that you can fix your scuffed wooden furniture with just a modest walnut? It might sound like we're pulling your leg, but it really does work. All you have to do is rub a walnut over the scratched surface several times before rubbing the area with your finger. The oil from the walnut will be absorbed into the wood and help to hide the ugly mark.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Put lemon juice on your avocado and guacamole to make it keep for longer</h2>
        <p>No one wants a browning avocado or guacamole. The key to keeping it green is squeezing some lemon or lime juice over it. The citric acid will prevent it from going brown for longer and adds an extra freshness to the flavour.
        </p>
        <h2>12. Use hair clips to organise long wires</h2>
        <p>Tame your unruly long wires with a simple claw clip. Wind your wires loosely around your hand until you have a thick circle of wires. Next, grab your hair accessory and use it to clip a bunch of the strands so that they stay grouped together.
        </p>
        <h2>13. Freeze fresh herbs with olive oil in an ice cube tray</h2>
        <p>Place herbs in ice cube trays before topping them up with olive oil and putting them in the freezer. When you want to use them, you can simply take out a frozen herby olive oil cube and voila!
        </p>
        <h2>14. Take the last sliver of a soap bar and stick in the new bar</h2>
        <p>Is that last bit of soap always getting lost down the plug? Save yourself the effort of trying to wash yourself with the dregs and make sure the remnants don't go to waste by sticking it onto your new bar.
        </p>
        <h2>15. Keep ginger in your freezer to make it last longer</h2>
        <p>Ensure your ginger stays fresher for longer by storing it in the freezer. Cut it into pieces beforehand so that when you take it out you're only taking out what you need.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Fold and store bedding inside a pillowcase</h2>
        <p>This nifty hack for life will keep your clean bedding tidy and has the added benefit of keeping them together. No more searching around for a loose pillowcase..
        </p>
        <h2>17. Use diluted white vinegar to clean just about anything in the house without needing a chemical-heavy product</h2>
        <p>A no-brainer when it comes to the best life hacks, this beauty will work wonders around your house. The acidic nature of vinegar means that it's great at dissolving dirt, grease and grime. Diluted white vinegar is especially good at ridding showers of limescale and keeping your chrome taps clean and shiny.
        </p>
        <h2>18. To deter spiders from coming inside use water and peppermint oil</h2>
        <p>Not a fan of spiders? Well, you'll be happy to hear that they're also not fans of peppermint. Spray your windows and doors with a diluted mix of water and peppermint oil to deter creepy crawlies from coming in.
        </p>
        <h2>19. The trick to opening a really difficult jar lid</h2>
        <p>This simple hack will save you a lot of time. No, you don't need the strength of Popeye to open that sealed jar. Simply wedge a spoon in between the seal to help get some air in and loosen it. Or, try running it under warm water.
        </p>
        <h2>20. Wrap your bananas in tin foil to make them last longer</h2>
        <p>One of the best 5-minute hacks that will keep your bananas fresher for a whole lot longer. Wrap the stems in aluminium foil to slow down the ripening process and the release of ethylene gas. Plus, be sure to keep them away from your other fruit to prevent them from going off sooner.
