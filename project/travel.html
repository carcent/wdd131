<p>
1. Download offline maps for easy access 
Download maps and use them offline. This is a great travel hack as you might not have continuous internet access while travelling to a new country. Even though offline maps offer limited features compared to online maps, they come in handy while navigating in a new city. Avoid getting lost while travelling with this simple hack. Google maps can be downloaded using a few simple steps. Just open the Google maps app on your phone and zoom in to select the area or search for the city’s map that you want to download. Now just click on the download offline option. You can now access the marked area even when you have patchy internet or even in aeroplane mode. Make sure to download offline maps when you have access to a good internet connection. 
<br><br>
2. Download Google translate to deal with the language barrier
Language can be a big hurdle while travelling to a new country. You can’t communicate with the locals or understand sign boards and menus. Google translate is the ultimate stress-free travel hack for all communication-related issues while travelling. Simply download Google translate before you travel to a new country which uses a different language to communicate. You can type or use a microphone to translate whatever you want to say. It also has a camera feature which uses your phone camera to translate any form of text. Just point your phone camera towards the text you want to read and the app uses augmented reality to translate it into your preferred language. This helps to deal with any language barrier you might face in a foreign land. 
<br><br>
3. Always carry a universal travel adapter 
Different countries use different types of plug points that might or might not be compatible with your electronic gadgets. With a universal adapter, you do not have to worry about the type of plug points or carrying a country-specific converter. Invest in a quality good universal adapter that works across countries. Today most adapters come with USB ports. 
<br><br>
4. Save on flight tickets 
One of the major expenses while travelling are the flight tickets. One of the best money-saving travel hacks on flight tickets is signing up for flight alerts on a travel aggregator. If you are flexible with your flight dates and travel destination, you can save a huge amount of money. Flight alerts keep you updated about any price drop or promotions offered by the airlines. You can also save money by opting for travel dates with cheaper flight rates.
<br><br>
5. Pack a travel first-aid kit
Carrying a basic first-aid kit while travelling is a must. Carry some basic medication, like painkillers, antihistamines, and stomach remedies, and keep them in a small pouch or bag that you can easily carry with you. With this, in case of minor health issues, you don’t have to run to a doctor while on a holiday. Even though you have access to medicines the world over, finding basic medication without a prescription can be an issue in certain countries. Also, medicines can have different names in other countries. 
<br><br>
6. Packing light luggage helps
A lot of people tend to overpack for vacations. Carrying heavy suitcases is always a hassle. Many low-cost airlines charge you for luggage. So a useful travel hack for easy travel is to pack light. Only bring what you need and try to avoid overpacking. This can save you from paying extra fees for overweight baggage and make your travels more comfortable. With light luggage, you can also save money by taking public transport instead of a taxi. It is also easy to travel between cities or switch hotels.
<br><br>
7. Use packing cubes to keep your luggage organised 
Packing cubes are a game changer when it comes to keeping everything in your luggage organised. Not only do they help you pack your luggage more efficiently, these handy lightweight organisers make unpacking a breeze. They make it easier to find what you need once you arrive at your destination.
<br><br>
8. Carry an extra phone charger and portable charger
Always bring an extra charger and a portable charger for your phone. Make sure to pack your chargers in your carry-on bag or purse, so you can access them easily during your travels. This way, you'll never be stuck with a dead phone. This is an easy yet stress-free travel hack. Carrying an extra phone charger when travelling is a great idea. Your phone is likely to be your lifeline when you're travelling, whether you're using it to navigate, take photos, or stay in touch with loved ones back home. Having an extra charger ensures that you can keep your phone charged up and ready to use at all times, even if you lose or damage your original charger. Always consider bringing a portable charger or power bank when travelling. This will be especially helpful when you have a long travel day. 
<br><br>
9. Learning a few basic phrases always helps
Try to learn some basic phrases in the language of the country you're visiting. It is not possible to learn a new language in a few days but learning a few lines can act as an icebreaker with the locals. This can help you communicate better with locals and make your travels more enjoyable. After all, cultural exchange is part of travel. Learn basic phrases and words for hello, thank you, etc. in the local language. 
<br><br>
10. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to use public Wi-Fi
Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) while travelling is highly recommended. It provides you with added data security and privacy when using public Wi-Fi networks. People often rely on public Wi-Fi hotspots at airports, coffee shops, and hotels while travelling. These public networks can be unsecured and a threat to crucial personal information, such as login credentials and banking details. VPN can encrypt your internet activity and make it difficult for anyone to intercept and read your data. VPNs can also provide you with a new IP address to protect your online identity and location. Make sure that the VPN network you choose operates in the country you are planning to visit.  
<br><br>
11. Take advantage of free walking tours when visiting a new city 
Many cities offer free walking tours that are a great introduction to the city, its local culture and attractions. These tours run daily and you tip the tour guide at the end of the tour. Free walking tours are a fantastic way to explore a new city for several reasons. They are cost-effective, you get local insights from local guides, you get to interact with fellow travellers and it's a great way to get the hang of a new city. They are a great way to make the most of your time in a new city.
<br><br>
12. Carry noise-cancelling headphones 
Noise-cancelling headphones are an excellent choice for anyone travelling, whether it be by aeroplane, train, or bus. These headphones use advanced technology to block out external noise, providing a more peaceful and relaxing listening experience. It is one of the best travel hacks to avoid unwanted noises like noisy seatmates, aeroplane sounds, etc. The constant hum of the aeroplane's engine and the sounds of other passengers can be very distracting and make it difficult to get some rest or work. Noise-cancelling headphones can help to block out these sounds, allowing you to better focus on your work or enjoy your music, audiobooks, or podcasts. 
<br><br>
13. Always carry a change of clothes and basic toiletries in your carry-on
Bringing a change of clothes in your carry-on when travelling is often a wise decision. Misplaced or delayed luggage at airports is not a rare occurrence. It is especially common during peak travel season or when you have connecting flights. To be on the safer side it is a good idea to carry a few necessary items and a change of clothes in your carry-on luggage. In case your luggage gets lost or delayed by a few days you don’t have to begin your vacation by spending your valuable time and money shopping for necessities.
<br><br>
14. Travel during shoulder season to save money and avoid massive crowd
People often think that the best time to travel to a destination is the peak season. But smart travellers know that the shoulder months are a better time to travel. These are the months just before and after the typical peak tourist season. Mostly these are the spring and autumn months. You not only get better deals on accommodation and flights but you also end up dealing with less of the crowd. The weather conditions can be slightly unpredictable around this time. It is the most trusted flying and booking travel hack followed by pro travellers. If you plan to travel during shoulder season then usually there is no need to make all the reservations and tour booking months in advance.
<br><br>
15. Hacks to follow when travelling with young kids 
Travelling with kids can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it can also be stressful and challenging at times. So to make your travel experience with kids smoother make sure to carry a bag filled with their favourite books and toys and always carry a few snacks. For ease, book a non-stop flight and try to take a flight or train to match the kids' sleeping time. Always research for kid-friendly activities at the destination beforehand. Never forget to carry a stroller if the trip involves a lot of walking. Keep the kid active before boarding the flight to help them sleep during the flight.
<br><br>
16. Keep offline copies of essential travel documents are reservations
It is important to have an offline copy of your passport, visa, flight tickets, vaccinations and other travel documents. They can be in the form of physical copies or can be saved offline on your phone. Make sure you can access them even without the internet. Also, always email these documents to yourself before you travel. If you are on any prescription medicine then it is advisable to keep a copy with you while travelling. 
<br><br>
17. Don’t skip travel insurance 
Travel insurance might seem like an added cost but it is helpful if you are in trouble in a foreign land. You or a member of your family can fall sick or there could be a theft or you can miss your flight, there are endless possible scenarios. Spending a small amount on travel insurance will result in safe and hassle-free travel. It's always wiser to have insurance. This is especially true if you're travelling with valuables or making changes to your plans regularly.
<br><br>
18. Carrying a refillable water bottle while travelling
Carrying a refillable water bottle while travelling is a great idea for several reasons. It is cost-effective as the overall price of buying multiple water bottles a day adds up at the end of the trip. Bringing a refillable water bottle can help you save money, especially in areas where bottled water is expensive. Having a water bottle with you at all times is convenient. You don't have to keep searching for a place to buy water. Most European cities have water fountains with free clean drinking water. Refillable water bottles are a sustainable alternative to single-use plastic bottles. They help minimise carbon footprint while travelling and reduce plastic waste. 
<br><br>
19. Get credit cards that give you free access to airport lounges
Travelling can be expensive, especially if you're not careful with your finances. We all can agree that food at airports is exorbitantly priced. One way to save some money while you're on the go is to sign up for a travel credit card that includes access to airport lounges. This way, you can enjoy free food and drinks, which can save you a lot of money. Isn’t it a useful money-saving travel hack? Additionally, you can make your wait more enjoyable by relaxing in an airport lounge. The lounge access comes in handy when you have a long waiting time at the airport. 
<br><br>
20. Engage in mild exercise to fight jet lag 
Jet lag can be tough, but there are ways to make it more manageable. One way is to get some exercise. Going for a run or doing light exercises like yoga or resistance band training can help you feel more alert and combat the effects of jet lag. Exercise can help reduce stress, boost your energy levels, and promote restful sleep. However, avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it may interfere with your sleep. Another tip is to avoid falling asleep after you board a flight or when you reach your destination. Stay hydrated during and after the flight. If needed take short naps and try to get into the local timezone as soon as possible. Remember that everyone's body responds differently to jet lag, so it may take a few days to adjust to the new time zone. Be patient and take care of yourself by eating healthy, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest.
<br><br>
21. Avoid exchanging currency at the airport
Even though it is convenient to exchange money for local currency at the airport, avoid doing it unless necessary. Airport exchange rates are known to be the worst. This is because exchange bureaus at the airport have higher overhead costs and thus may charge higher fees or offer less favourable exchange rates than other places. For better rates, it's best to exchange money at a bank or a reputable exchange bureau in the city. However, if you need to exchange money at the airport, only do it for the minimum amount required. Alternatively, you can consider using a credit or debit card that does not charge foreign transaction fees and has favourable exchange rates. This can be a convenient and cost-effective way to access local currency while travelling. Remember, travelling is all about exploring new places, experiencing new cultures, and having fun. These travel hacks can help you make the most of your trip and enjoy your time away from home.
